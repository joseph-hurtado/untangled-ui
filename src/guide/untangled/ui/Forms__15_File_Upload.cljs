  "# Forms â€“ File Upload

  There are a few steps for setting up a working file upload control:

  1. Install file upload server support in your server's Ring stack and add logic for dealing with
  forms submissions that contain uploaded files.
  2. Run the server
  3. Add file-upload networking as an extra remote in Untangled Client (requires v0.8.1+, and Om alpha48+)
  4. Load the page through your server (not figwheel).

  ### Customizing the Ring Stack

  If you're using the modular server support for Untangled, then you can build a stack that contains at least
  the following middleware: transit, API hander, file upload, and wrap-multipart-params. Other bits are also
  commonly useful. Here's a sample middleware component that has been tested to work:

  TODO: Show how to inject this into the normal API handler so you can access the files on form submission...

  TODO: Finish upload handler (needs metadata and storage plugin, like image upload...probably just use that)

  TODO: For now, just look at upload-server namespace in dev source directory.

  ```
  (defrecord CustomMiddleware [middleware api-handler]
    component/Lifecycle
    (stop [this] (dissoc this :middleware))
    (start [this]
      (assoc this :middleware
                  (-> not-found
                    (MIDDLEWARE api-handler) ; Normal API handler
                    wrap-file-upload ; REMOTE HANDLER (needs transit for response)
                    middleware/wrap-transit-params
                    middleware/wrap-transit-response
                    (wrap-resource \"public\")
                    wrap-content-type
                    wrap-not-modified
                    wrap-params
                    wrap-multipart-params ; TURN UPLOADS INTO DISK FILES
                    wrap-gzip))))

  ### Adding UC File Upload remote

  The client-side setup is very simple, just add a `:networking` parameter to your client that has a map
  containing the normal remote and a file upload remote:

  ```
  (new-untangled-client
    :networking {:remote      (net/make-untangled-network \"/api\" :global-error-callback identity)
                 :file-upload (untangled.ui.file-upload/file-upload-networking)})
  ```

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source FileUploadDemo))

(defcard form-file-upload
  (untangled-app CommitRoot
    :networking {:remote      (net/make-untangled-network "/api" :global-error-callback identity)
                 :file-upload (file-upload-networking)})
  {}
  {:inspect-data false})
